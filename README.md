## Hey there, I'm Bradley Hogle

I'm a software developer at a brick-and-mortar business called PhotoVision. I'm biased, but I think we're one of the top film photography labs in the country.

### Some things I can do
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI); JavaScript / TypeScript, React, Astro, NextJS; Ruby on Rails; Elixir / Phoenix
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, Prisma, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Active Record; Data modeling for production systems
- **CI/CD and Infrastructure:** Docker, Linux, Nginx, Dokku (self-hosted Heroku-style deployments to VPS), AWS S3
- **Product, Systems, & Integrations:** End-to-end ownership of full-stack web applications; API design and third-party integrations; Stripe, Square; Legacy system modernization

### Some things I've done
- Owned end to end delivery of high-throughput image processing, e-commerce workflows, and internal production systems for a national photography lab.
- Led the development of a custom image delivery application using Python and Django, achieving a 300% savings in Dropbox API fees and delivering 22,000+ image galleries to over 3,300 customers to date. Serves resized images from cloud storage via AWS S3, lightweight custom JS/CSS frontend for customer-facing galleries
- Guided 3-member team in the creation of a color-correction training application in Rails. The team repurposed the application as a customer-facing game attracting 138 users. Custom frontend via the Canvas API and Hotwire, Chart.js to visualize user statistics, Square payment integration
- Improved website Lighthouse scores from the 60s to the high 90s. Refactored front-end JavaScript to use faster image loading and image caching strategies
- Surveyed front-desk employees to identify inefficient workflow, then automated order processes (83% reduction of labor time) using Python/Flask.
- Modernized image processing infrastructure to an HTTP-based Python/FastAPI internal image transfer system, resolving costly networking issues.
