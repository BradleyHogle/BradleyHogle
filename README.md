## Hey there, I'm Bradley Hogle

I'm a software developer at a brick-and-mortar business called PhotoVision. I'm biased, but I think we're one of the top film photography labs in the country.

### My journey at PhotoVision so far:
- Frontend ->
- Elixir/Phoenix ->
- More frontend ->
- A little C# / .net ->
- More frontend ->
- Diagnosed with JEF (Javascript Ecosystem Fatigue*) ->
- Python (Django, but also random things)


*If you worry that you also might have JEF, speak with a professional today. And though I am a non-medical provider, consider SolidJS, Astro, or Svelte the next time you want to start a greenfield project.
